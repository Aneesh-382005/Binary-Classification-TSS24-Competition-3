# Kaggle Competition: Predicting Smoking Status

This repository contains my submission for the Kaggle competition project on predicting smoking status based on medical data. The goal is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person smokes or not.

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict the smoking status of individuals using various machine learning algorithms. The main objective is to optimize the model performance while preventing overfitting.

## Data Description
- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features and target variable 'smoking'.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset for which we need to predict the smoking status.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the required format.
